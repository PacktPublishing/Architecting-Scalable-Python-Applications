# Architecting Scalable Python Applications
This is the code repository for [Architecting Scalable Python Applications](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/architecting-scalable-python-applications?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788622646), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
This video starts off by defining scalability and Concurrency. Their relationship and effects on performance attributes. We will also look at Celery which is a very important aspect of python.
Then we will move to security aspects of Python and find out whether it is secured or not.
Finally, we will look at design patterns that are creational, structural and behavioural patterns.
This video will help you understand the inns and outs of Python so that you can make those critical design decisions that are just live up to but also surpass the expectations of your clients.
